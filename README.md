Minesweeper is a puzzle game that wrote using `reactjs` and `styled-components`.

### Rules

 You should uncover all the "safe" cells without clicking a cell containing a mine. When you click on cell, you will see numbers. Each number represents the number of mines adjacent to that cell. Mark mined cells with a ðŸš©using right-click to prevent misclicks. Counter on the top right shows you how many have mines left. Good luck.

The most fun is how fast you can win a game. Go play it [now](https://shdq.github.io/minesweeper/).
